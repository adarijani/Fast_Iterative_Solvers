# Programming Exercises for Fast Iterative Solvers

This repository contains programming exercises corresponding to the lectures "Fast Iterative Solvers" held by [Prof. May](https://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/en/people/may) at RWTH Aachen University.


The assignments have been completed together with [Tobias Pohlen](http://geekstack.net/).

The examples have been tested using MatLab 2014b on Ubuntu 12.04 with OpenCV 2.4.

## Building

The C++ examples are built using GNU Make and based on C++ and Python. As an example for bulding and running the Multigrid project:
```sh
cd multigrid
bash ./auto.sh
```
