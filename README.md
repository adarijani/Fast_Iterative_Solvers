# Programming Exercises for Fast Iterative Solvers

This repository contains programming exercises corresponding to the lectures "Fast Iterative Solvers" held by [Prof. Georg May](https://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/en/people/may) at RWTH Aachen University.

## Building

The ```C++``` examples are built using ```GNU Make``` and based on ```C++``` and ```Python```. The followings are required to
build and run the project:

* A ```UNIX/Linux/POSIX``` system.
* ```bash``` shell.
* A ```C++``` compiler.
* ```GNU Make``` build management system.
* A ```python``` interpreter with ```Matplotlib``` installed.
* A ```pdf``` viewer.


As an example for building and running the Multigrid project:
```sh
cd multigrid/project/code
bash ./auto.sh
```
